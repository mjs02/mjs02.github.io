            <h2>Red - Taylor Swift</h2>
            <p>
                Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street<br>
                Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly<br>
                Loving him is like trying to change your mind<br>
                Once you're already flying through the free fall<br>
                Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all<br>
                Losing him was blue, like I'd never known<br>
                Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
                Forgetting him was like trying to know<br>
                Somebody you never met<br>
                But loving him was red<br>
                Loving him was red<br>
                Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted<br>
                Was right there in front of you<br>
                Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words<br>
                To your old favorite song<br>
                Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword<br>
                And realizing there's no right answer<br>
                Regretting him was like wishing you never found out<br>
                That love could be that strong<br>
                Losing him was blue, like I'd never known<br>
                Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
                Forgetting him was like trying to know<br>
                Somebody you never met<br>
                But loving him was red<br>
                Oh, red<br>
                Burning red<br>
                Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes<br>
                Tell myself it's time now gotta let go<br>
                But moving on from him is impossible<br>
                When I still see it all in my head<br>
                In burning red<br>
                Burning, it was red<br>
                Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known<br>
                Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
                Forgetting him was like trying to know<br>
                Somebody you never met<br>
                'Cause loving him was red<br>
                Yeah, yeah, red<br>
                Burning red<br>
                And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head<br>
                Comes back to me, burning red<br>
                Yeah, yeah<br>
                His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
